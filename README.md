To obtain the dataset, see the following [link.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data)

Click on properties_2016.csv, train_2016_v2.csv, properties_2017.csv, train_2017.csv, and sample_submission.csv to obatin all five of the needed files.

The sample_submission file should be placed in the main directory with the code files. The other 4 should be placed in the "data" directory.

The following packages are required to successfully run the code in this project:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sci-kit Learn
- CatBoost [link.](https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/doc/dg/concepts/python-installation-docpage/)
- XGBoost [link.](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)
- Bokeh [link.](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html)

The files Train_2016.py, Train_2017.py, Predictor_2016.py, and Predictor_2017.py were used to train, predict, and create the actual submission file for the competition.
